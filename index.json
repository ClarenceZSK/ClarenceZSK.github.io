Compare to the visual cues from images captured by camera, APs are few but persistent, even out of sight (behind walls) while visual features are rich but changeable with the field of view.\n","date":1591315200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1591315200,"objectID":"082eb4cd6444ff3e954146abe2727d5b","permalink":"/project/full-3d-wifi-based-state-estimation/","publishdate":"2020-06-05T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/full-3d-wifi-based-state-estimation/","section":"project","summary":"We take ubiquitous WiFi to achieve fully 3D MAV state estimation.","tags":["State Estimation"],"title":"Fully 3D WiFi-based MAV State Estimation","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Monocular visual based state estimators fail to work in textureless venues due to the lack of visual features or reliable feature matching.
