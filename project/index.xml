      <title>Conquering Textureless with RF and Monocular Vision</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Monocular visual based state estimators fail to work in textureless venues due to the lack of visual features or erroneous feature matching. Recently, RF sensing has been proved to be an effective sensing modality that complements the visual sensing. However, its accuracy is limited due to the large wavelength and environmental interference of RF signals. We are currently working on an exciting project that combines RF and visual sensing to fill the gap of accurate state estimation in textureless regions.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Fully 3D WiFi-based MAV State Estimation</title>
      <link>http://www.sheng-kai.top/project/full-3d-wifi-based-state-estimation/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We take ubiquitous WiFi to extract absolute-relative drift-free environmental sensing features. Inspiring from visual-based state estimators, we view WiFi access points (APs) as environmental features whose geometrical relationship to the vehicle is established by WiFi signals. The PHY information of WiFi holds the cues of MAV positions and attitudes as well as APs&amp;rsquo; positions. Compare to the visual cues from images captured by camera, APs are few but persistent, even out of sight (behind walls) while visual features are rich but changeable with the field of view.&lt;/p&gt;
